   2. Mount the File System on /data directory
   3. Verify File System utilization using ‘df -h’ command – This command must show /data file system
   4. Create file ‘f1’ in the /data file system.
9. Login as ‘user5’ and perform below

4. Unmount /data file system
5. Delete /data directory
11. Login to AWS and detach EBS volume to the EC2 Instance and delete the volume and then terminate EC2 instance.
